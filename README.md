# Amethar
My .NET graduation project from 2015, inspired by Infinity Engine RPGs such as Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale.

Place the **resources** and **cinematics** compressed archives inside the application's executable folder for a complete experience. It contains the sounds, music, example saved games and the intro cinematic video.
